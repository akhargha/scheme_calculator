Note: All expressions and exceptions are working except complex brackets where I have to compute multiple expressions inside bracketsâ€” example: ( + ( - 3 2 ( / 4 5 ) ) )
The 3rd standard input: ( + ( - 6 ) ( * 2 3 4 ) ( / ( + 3 ) ( * ) ( - 2 3 1 ) ) ) 
cannot be solved by my program and gives out a wrong answer.
The developed 3rd standard input CAN be solved by my program: ( + ( - 6 ) ( * 2 3 4 ) ( / 3 1 -2 ) )
